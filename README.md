## Invite
If you'd like to add **GiveawayBot** to your server, use the following link:<br>
ðŸ”— **https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?permissions=347200&scope=bot&client_id=294882584201003009**

## Usage
* **!gstart <time> [prize]** - Starts a new giveaway in the current channel. Users can react with a ðŸŽ‰ to enter the giveaway. The time is in seconds, unless you end the time in an "m" (Example times: `50` or `45s` or `3m`)
* **!greroll [messsageId]** - Re-rolls a winner. If you proved a message ID, it rerolls the giveaway at that ID. If you leave it blank, it looks in the current channel for the most recent giveaway and rerolls from that.
